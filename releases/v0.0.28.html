  <p class="release-summary">
    Finance-forward sprint: reconciliations stay in lockstep with the ledger, forecasting tiles summarize the quarter,
    and transaction edits stay safer by writing through shared Gun nodes with clearer audit context. Navigation remains
    consistent so contributors can jump between finance, CRM, and calendar without losing their place.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Finance moved from experimental to dependable. Reconciliation checkpoints mirror the real ledger, forecasting
      tiles summarize cash posture for the coming quarter, and edits stay reversible thanks to audit-friendly Gun
      writes. We aligned navigation to keep finance close to CRM records and scheduled follow-ups, so teams can trace
      revenue and spend back to the people and meetings that drive them.
    </p>
