    OpenAI Workbench lead: ship AI-built sites faster with connected GitHub/Vercel guides while Stripe subscriber
    scoring, admin leaderboards, and guided CRM follow-ups keep rewards and revenue teams aligned.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This sprint opens with an OpenAI Workbench spotlight so builders can generate, commit, and deploy AI-created sites
      without losing context. Stripe subscribers dedupe into a live leaderboard, the admin console can search accounts
      and award points immediately, and the portal surfaces score rewards in the app hub. CRM contributors gain a weekly
      contact challenge plus a guided touch logger that pairs notes with scheduled follow-ups so revenue teams keep
      momentum.
