## What is 3DVR Portal?

The **3DVR Portal** is the entry point and central hub for the 3DVR community: a decentralized, open-source platform where people come together to:

- **Collaborate on open-source projects** in web, VR, gaming, hardware, and education.
- **Propose and launch new ideas and startups** in a supportive community.
- **Learn and grow skills** with access to mentors, tutorials, and collaborative coding.
- **Earn rewards and funding** for contributing meaningfully to projects.
- **Build the future** of open and ergonomic computing, decentralized communication, and community-driven hardware and software.

We are making tools and products **by the community, for the community** — and ensuring that anyone who participates can also benefit financially, socially, and professionally.

If you believe in empowering people to create together and own what they build — **welcome home.**

## Getting Started

### Use the Portal

The portal is live and hosted at:

[**→ Visit the 3DVR Portal**](https://3dvr-portal.vercel.app)

You can sign up, join the chat, and start contributing right now — no downloads or installs required.

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmsteph/3dvr-portal.git
cd 3dvr-portal
open index.html
```

### Calendar Hub developer preview

The new calendar prototype lives at `calendar/index.html`. To experiment with Google or Outlook:

1. Generate OAuth tokens using your own developer accounts (Google Cloud or Azure).
2. Open the Calendar Hub page locally and paste the access tokens into the connection cards.
3. Use the **Fetch events** button to call the lightweight proxy in `/api/calendar` and list your upcoming events.
4. Use the **Create quick events** form to push meetings back to the connected provider.

Tokens are stored in `localStorage` only, making it easy to iterate while you wire up a production-ready OAuth flow.
